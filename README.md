# David Rios Portfolio

The purpose of this website is to showcase my html, css, javascript and jquery skills. It also showcases a focus on responsive design.

Below is a run-down of the features included in this site.

## The palette

The palette used was a monochromatic palette from www.coolors.co. The palette consists of various shades of gray. The idea was that the palette would allow viewers to focus on the work rather than on the site. Plus, gray is neutral and goes with just about any color.

## Header built with Jquery

Building the header with Jquery achieved a couple of goals. One was to simplify the HTML on every page. The second was to write the code for the header once and use it on every page. I was able to do that utlizing Jquery. The formatting for the header is done in CSS.

In order for the design to be responsive, inline-block was used to display the header elements so they would adjust 

## Hamburger menu

The hamburger menu and a media query were introduced to make the design. Once the screen is reduced to a width of 480 pixels, the media query causes the sub-links in the top navigation menu to disappear, thereby requiring the user to use the hamburger icon instead to navigate around the site. 

The hamburger menu was based on a w3schools tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp

The media query was also based on a w3schools tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp


## Home Page

The boxes presented on the page were based on a w3schools tutorial that demonstrated how to present information in the format of 3 dimensional cards.

## About Me page

The About Me page is simple and features only a photo and some text. The style option Float was used to wrap text around the photo.

### Gallery

The gallery consists of a table with one row and two cells: one to hold the navigation links, and the other to hold the divs that have the photo galleries. Users can click an option in the left-hand navigation bar to see only photos related to a specific shoot. Clicking on any of the links calls functions that either show or hide the appropriate divs.

I based my galler on a w3schools tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_image_gallery
