                David's origin story in tech begins in the late 1990's while he was employed 
                at an insurance company. He taught himself database design and application development in
                in order to solve an existing business problem. After three months he showed his finished product to upper
                management, and in that moment his tech career was born.<br><br>

                Since then, David has been a software developer, project manager, scrum master, systems analyst 
                and technical curriculum developer. Out all of these, he prefers software development because he gets to
                create solutions that make his business partners' jobs easier.<br><br>

                In his personal time, David is a fan of both sumo wrestling and photography. He has traveled 
                around the country photographing tournaments, and has traveled as far as Hau'ula, Hawaii. 
                His next project is to author a coffee-table photo book featuring American sumo wrestlers and 
                how sumo wrestling turned street kids around and healed their emotional trauma.<br><br>
                David lives in Austin, Texas and enjoys both film and digital photography. When he's not 
                in his darkroom developing film, he can be found paddle boarding, hiking, tinkering with vintage
                 computers, or hanging out with his dog Luna.
